# Skin-Lesion-Classification-and-Segmentation
## A pair of models that classify and segment skin lesions
### (If Github doesn't render the Jupyter notebook, view it here: https://nbviewer.org/github/tzviblonder/Skin-Lesion-Classification-and-Segmentation/blob/main/Skin%20Lesion%20Classifier%20%26%20Segmentation.ipynb)

#### The first model is a convolutional neural network the classifies skin lesions into one of seven cancerous or noncancerous categories. The second model uses a "u-net" architecture to segment the part of the image containing the skin lesion from the rest. The second model recycles many layers from the first. 
#### For more details, see the notebook.
